# Technical-Test-Codex

One of the parts of the Codex summer job process is taking the technical exam.
Seven days were given to perform at least two problems out of eight. The computer's language is optional, but the problem requirements must be solved and not only the functioning of the code will be evaluated.
  
  
### Exercises performed 
  
Among the eight possible problems to be carried out, four were chosen. The problems solved were 1,4,5 and 7.
